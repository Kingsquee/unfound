./state/state.rs references a library (in this case, foo), but doesn't use it
```
extern crate foo;

pub struct State {
    pub a: usize
}

impl State {
    pub fn new() -> State {
        State {
            a: 0
        }
    }
}
```

./process/process.rs also references the library, but uses it
```
extern crate state;
use state::State;

extern crate foo;
use foo::bar;

pub fn execute(state: &mut State) {
    state.a = bar();
    println!("{}", state.a);
}
```

./kernel/kernel.rs just links them together
```
extern crate state;
extern crate process;

use state::State;

fn main() {
    let mut state = State::new();
    process::execute(&mut state);
}
```

when we execute ./build.sh (calls rustc/cargo and links the libraries with LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
```
[kingsley@thinkpad cargo]$ ./build.sh

That should have printed 12...
```

If we remove 'extern crate foo;' from state.rs, it will build fine.
```
pub struct State {
    pub a: usize
}

impl State {
    pub fn new() -> State {
        State {
            a: 0
        }
    }
}
```

Interestingly, if we *use* foo in state.rs, it will also build fine!
```
extern crate foo;

use foo::bar;

pub struct State {
    pub a: usize
}

impl State {
    pub fn new() -> State {
        State {
            a: bar()
        }
    }
}
```

Why this occurs, I have no idea, but apparently plugin=true is not enoughâ„¢. Help would be greatly appreciated.
