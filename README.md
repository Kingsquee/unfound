These two dirs each contain a simplified version of [Worldsong's](https://github.com/Kingsquee/Worldsong) architecture, which demonstrates a cargo-related linking issue I'm dealing with.

Check out the 'cargo' dir first, and play with the "solutions".
Afterwards, check out the 'nocargo' dir, and raise an eyebrow or two!

The practical effect of this is, using third party libraries with Worldsong is unpleasant, approaching impossible. Help solving this would be incredibly appreciated.
